This simulates a parking garage. The goal is to implment the SpaceAssigner class.

The following rules apply:
1. Implement as few interfaces as possible.
2. A parking space as a desirability as well as a indication if it is taken or not.
3. A car must be asssigned the most desirable space which is taken.
4. If all spaces are taken null is returned.
5. Assume that the application are supposed to run on low-end devices with low memory and processing power.
6. Implement test cases to prove that the solution works.
